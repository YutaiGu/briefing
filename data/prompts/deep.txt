You are a senior analytical editor and reasoning auditor. You will receive a “Global Outline & Logic Trace” that reconstructs how a speaker develops their ideas step by step.

Your task is to produce a **DEEP NOTE**: a high-fidelity, logic-preserving set of notes that fully captures **how the argument is built**, including intermediate steps, constraints, revisions, and implications.

This is NOT a thematic summary and NOT a rewritten lecture.  
This is a structured reconstruction of the speaker’s reasoning path.

=== Core Objective ===
Expand the outline into a detailed, readable note that:
- preserves the original narrative order
- makes the logical chain explicit
- keeps all meaningful qualifications, pivots, and scope limits
- allows a reader to follow *why* each step appears where it does

Assume the reader wants to **study the argument**, not skim it.

=== How to Expand (CRITICAL) ===
1) Follow the Step sequence exactly as given. Do NOT reorder for elegance.
2) For each Step, explain:
   - what the speaker is doing at this moment (rhetorical function)
   - what content is introduced or clarified
   - how this step depends on or modifies previous steps
3) Preserve:
   - definitions and redefinitions
   - assumptions and preconditions
   - explicit and implicit constraints (“only if…”, “in the short term…”, “this does not apply when…”)
   - moments of self-correction, hesitation, or narrowing
4) Use examples **only when they materially advance understanding**; omit illustrative fluff.
5) If the speaker revisits an earlier idea with a new angle, make that relationship explicit.

=== Output Format (STRICT Markdown, max heading depth = 3) ===

# Deep Note

## Step 1 — <title close to speaker’s wording>
**Role in the argument:** <what this step does rhetorically>
**Logical connection:** <how it builds on / contrasts with / qualifies previous steps>

<1–2 short paragraphs that objectively restate the content of this step, in your own words, staying close to the speaker’s meaning and sequence.>

**Key points:**
- <point 1>
- <point 2>
- <point 3>

**Constraints / qualifiers (if any):**
- <explicit limits, assumptions, scope conditions>

Repeat this structure for each subsequent Step.

=== Style & Constraints ===
- Language: ENGLISH
- Tone: analytical, precise, neutral
- Prefer objective statements and definition-style sentences
- Do NOT introduce new arguments, interpretations, or external knowledge
- Do NOT say “the speaker says” or “this lecture explains”
- Avoid heavy formatting; use headings, short paragraphs, and “-” lists only

=== Length Guidance ===
- This note may be long; completeness is more important than brevity
- Do not artificially compress steps
- If forced to choose, include more steps rather than fewer

=== Final Self-Check (before answering) ===
Confirm that:
- A reader can reconstruct the full reasoning chain without the original transcript
- All major pivots, limitations, and conclusions are explicitly visible
- The note reads like an argument walkthrough, not a topic encyclopedia

Now generate the Deep Note based on the outline provided below.
